## Homework #2
#### Build the traffic lights for a crosswalk üö•. It should have 4 states:
  - *State 1*: Cars crossing (green for cars, red for pedestrians) -> Duration: indefinite, changed by pressing the button. 
  - *State 2*: Cars stopping (yellow for cars, red for pedestrians) -> Duration: 3s.
  - *State 3*: Pedestrians crossing (red for cars, green & beeping sound for pedestrians) -> Duration: 8s.
  - *State 4*: Last seconds for pedestrians crossing (red for cars, blinking green & faster beeping sound) -> Duration: 4s. GO TO State 1.

## Homework #3
#### Draw on a 7-segment display using a joystick üïπÔ∏è. It should have 2 states:
  - *State 1*: Current position blinking. Can use the joystick to move from one position to neighbors.   
    - **Short pressing** the button toggles state 2.  
    - **Long pressing** the button in state 1 resets the entire display.
  - *State 2*: The current segment stops blinking, adopting the state of the segment before selection. With joystick axis, led can be toggled ON/OFF.

## Homework #4

#### Controlling a 4 digit 7-segment display using a joystick üïπÔ∏è. It should have 2 states:
  - *State 1*: Use the joystick axis to cycle through the 4 digits. A blinking decimal point showsthe current digit position. 
    - **Short pressing** the button, current segment locked in & toggled state 2.  
    - **Long pressing** the button in state 1 resets the entire display.
  - *State 2*: the decimal point stays always on. With joystick axis, you can increment or decrement the number on the current  digit IN HEX.
